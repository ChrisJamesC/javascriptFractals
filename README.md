Configurable fractals in Javascript. 

[Demo](http://chrisjamesc.github.io/javascriptFractals/)

The goal of this project is to show what it is now possible to do in Javascript. This project is optimized for Google Chrome.

This project focuses on Escape-time fractals but don't hesitate to contribute in order to show more types of fractals.


Based on [syntagmatic zoomable Julia](http://bl.ocks.org/3736720) and [DougX's Canvas Fractals](http://dougx.net/fractals/fractals.html).
